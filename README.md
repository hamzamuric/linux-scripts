# My linux scripts

kill-script needs process id, so you can give it with a few piped commands.
exapple:
```ps -aux | grep <process_name> | ~/./kill-script
```
(if script is in your home directory)

in this repository are scripts for:

+ mounting (mounting usb flash drive)
+ unmounting (unmounting usb flash drive)
